*** DESCRIPTION ***

From a dataset, d-peeler computes every closed n-set (i.e., maximal
rectangles of 1 modulo permutations on any of the sets) satisfying
given constraints. With the --minimize (-m) option, it also
post-treats these patterns to output a minimization of the input
dataset.


*** RETURN VALUES ***

d-peeler returns values which can be used when called from a
script. They are conformed to sysexit.h.
* 0 is returned when d-peeler terminates successfully.
* 64 is returned when d-peeler was called incorrectly.
* 65 is returned when an input data line is not properly formatted.
* 74 is returned when data could not be read or written on the disk.


*** GENERAL ***

* d-peeler --help (or simply d-peeler -h) displays a reminder of the
different options which can be passed to d-peeler.
* d-peeler --version (or simply d-peeler -V) displays version
information.


*** OPTIONS ***

Any option, but the general ones listed above, can either be specified
on the command line or in an option file. If an option is present both
in the option file and on the command line, the latter is used.

The option file can be specified through option --opt. When omitted, a
file named as the input data file + ".opt" is supposed to be the
option file related to the input data file. For example, if the input
data file name is "dataset.txt" and "dataset.txt.opt" exists, it is
supposed to be the related option file.

The options have the same name in the option file as on the command
line. Only long names can be used though. Arguments passed to an
option are separated from the name of the option by "=". As an
example, these lines may constitute an option file:
minimize = true
ids = ": "
area = 2
ac = 2 0.5 0.5


*** INPUT DATA ***

The name of the file containing the input data set must be passed as
an argument to d-peeler.

The syntax of the input data set is flexible. Every line must be
either empty (it is ignored) or contain n fields (each of them related
to a dimension) where n is the number of dimensions. Each field may,
itself, gather several items. Several different separators may be used
to separate the dimensions and the same goes for the separations of
the items in a dimension. The items can be any string (as far as they
do not include any of the separators!). Let us take an example. This
line could be part of an input data set:
01-09-2007: Thomas,Harry,Max basketball,gymnastics

There are 3 dimensions in this data set: the first one gathers dates,
the second pupils and the last one sports. The dimensions are
separated by the characters ":" or/and " ". The fact that two
dimensions are separated by several separators (in our example both
":" and " " separate the dates from the pupils) does not raise any
trouble. The items are always separated by ",".

To be properly understood, one must indicate to d-peeler the
separators used otherwise defaults are used (" " to separate
dimensions and "," to separate "items"). The related options are --ids
for Input Dimension Separators and --iis for Input Item Separators. In
the previous example, d-peeler can be called as follows:
$ d-peeler --ids ": " dataset
There is no need to the option --iis since the default value is
correct.

In conjunction with the option --minimize (-m), the name of a data
file gathering a "Don't Care Set" can be passed to d-peeler through
option --dcs. When ommitted, a file named as the input data file +
".dcs" is supposed to be the "Don't Care Set" related to the input
data file. For example, if the input data file name is "dataset.txt"
and "dataset.txt.dcs" exists, it is supposed to be the related "Don't
Care" file. The "Don't Care Set" must be formatted like the input data
set.


*** OUTPUT DATA ***

The output data looks like the input data. Without the option
--minimize (-m), each line is a closed n-set. With the option
--minimize (-m), the whole output covers everything from the original
data set but, hopefully, has a smaller size.

Option --out (-o) is used to set the output file name. When omitted,
the output file name is the output file name is the input file name +
".out". For example, if the input file name is "dataset.txt", the
default output file name is "dataset.txt.out".

The dimensions are separated by a string specified through option
--ods (by default " "). The items are separated by a string specified
through option --ois (by default ","). An empty set is output with the
string specified through option --empty (-e) (by default "ø"). The
whole set is output with the string specified through option --all (by
default "-").

Moreover, d-peeler can append to each pattern, information describing
it. When called with option --ps, it prints the number of items in
each dimension. When called with option --pa, it prints the area
(where each dimension may be weighted if used in conjunction with
--ac) of the pattern. The separators used can be specified:
* --css sets the string separating the pattern from the number of
items in each dimension (by default " : ")
* --ss, used in conjunction with --css, sets the string separating two
sizes (by default " ")
* --sas sets the string separating the pattern or the sizes (when used
in conjunction with --css) from the number of items in each dimension
(by default " : ")


*** CONSTRAINTS ***

Constraints on the computed closed n-sets can be pushed in their
extraction. Their use reduces the extraction time.

Constraints regarding the delta-maximality of any dimension of the
computed closed n-sets can be set with option --delta (-d). One float
(between 0 and 1) per dimension must be given. By default the
classical maximality (0 for every dimension) is used. On the command
line, do not forget to protect the list of floats by using double
quotes ("). For example, the following command can be used to compute
closed 3-sets whose two first dimension are maximal and the last set
is 0.5-maximal):
$ d-peeler -d "0 0 0.5" dataset

Constraints regarding the minimal number of items which any computed
closed n-set must gather in each dimension can be set with option
--sizes (-s). One integer per dimension must be given. By default no
size constraint is applied (0 for every dimension). On the command
line, do not forget to protect the list of integers by using double
quotes ("). For example, the following command can be used to compute
closed 3-sets with at least 4 items in the first dimension:
$ d-peeler -s "4 0 0" dataset

Constraints regarding the maximal number of items which any computed
closed n-set is allowed to gather in each dimension can be set with
option --Sizes (-S). One integer per dimension must be given. By
default no maximal size constraint are applied. On the command line,
do not forget to protect the list of integers by using double quotes
("). For example, the following command can be used to compute
closed 3-sets with at most 4 items in the first dimension:
$ d-peeler -S "4 0 0" dataset

Constraints regarding the minimal area of any computed closed n-set
can be set with option --area (-a). By default no area constraint is
applied (minimal area of 0).

Constraints regarding the maximal area of any computed closed n-set
can be set with option --Area (-A). By default no maximal area
constraint is applied.

Furthermore, different weights may be given to each dimension using
option --ac. One float per dimension must be given. By default the
classical area measure (coefficient 1 for every dimension) is used. On
the command line, do not forget to protect the list of floats by using
double quotes ("). For example, let us consider the following call:
$ d-peeler -a 4.5 --ac "0 1 1 0.5" dataset
In this example, the product of the number of items in the second
dimension by the number of items in the third dimension by the square
root of the number of items in the last dimension must be at least 4.5
for the closed 4-set to be output.

When dimensions in the input data form an undirected graph and only
cliques (for any computed pattern, the sets of items in these
dimensions must be the same) are searched, option --clique (-c)
achieves it. The IDs of the dimensions must be given. These IDs start
at 0. On the command line, do not forget to protect the list of IDs by
using double quotes ("). For example, to compute cliques in a graph
whose nodes are given in the two first dimensions (the possible
remaining dimensions gather labels on the edges), d-peeler must be
called as follows:
$ d-peeler -c "0 1" dataset

A constraint regarding a minimal minimization ratio can be set with
option --mr. It is the ratio between the area and the number of logic
operators needed to express an n-set.


*** CONSTRAINTS ON GROUPS OF ITEMS ***

Groups of items can be defined in files whose paths are passed in
argument to the option --groups (-g). The file paths must not include
any space since this character is used as a separator. On the command
line, do not forget to protect the list of paths by using double
quotes ("). Every file relates to a different group whose composition
is unrestricted. In particular, a group can contain items from
different dimensions and the groups can overlap or even be included
into each others.

The syntax of a file defining a group is flexible. Every line must be
either empty (it is ignored) or contain two fields. The first field
must be an integer between 0 and n - 1 and specifies the ID of a
dimension (i.e., the position in the input data starting with 0). The
list of items, in the second field, therefore are searched in this
dimension. If an item is not found, a warning is issued and the item
is ignored. Notice that the list of items can be reduced to one single
item and several lines can deal with the same dimension.

Several different separators may be used to separate dimension IDs
from the list of items. The same goes for the separations of the items
in a dimension. Let us take an example. These three line could be part
of a group file:
0: 01-09-2007
1 Thomas,Harry
1:Max

This group contains four items, one in the first dimension (whose ID
is 0) and three in the second dimension (whose ID is 1). The
dimensions are separated from the lists of items by the characters ":"
or/and " ". The fact that two dimensions are separated by several
separators (in our example both ":" and " " are used on the first
line) does not raise any trouble. The items are, in this example,
always separated by ",".

By default, d-peeler assumes that the characters set with --ids
separate not only the dimensions of the input data but also the
dimension IDs from the lists of items in a file describing a group. In
the same way, d-peeler assumes that the characters set with --iis
separate the items in both the input data and the groups. If the
separators of the input data differ from those used in the groups,
--gds (resp. --gis) must be used to set the characters separating, in
the groups, the dimension IDs from the items (resp. the items from
each others).

Constraints regarding the minimal number of items which any computed
closed n-set must gather in each group can be set with option
--gs. One integer per group must be given in the same order as the one
used to specify the groups. By default all items in the groups must be
present. On the command line, do not forget to protect the list of
integers by using double quotes ("). For example, the following
command can be used to compute closed n-sets with at least 4 items in
the group1 and at least 2 items in group2:
$ d-peeler -g "group1 group2" --gs "4 2" dataset

Constraints regarding the maximal number of items which any computed
closed n-set is allowed to gather in each group can be set with option
--gS. One integer per dimension must be given in the same order as the
one used to specify the groups. By default no maximal size constraint
are applied on the groups. On the command line, do not forget to
protect the list of integers by using double quotes ("). For example,
the following command can be used to compute closed n-sets with at
most 4 items in group1 and at most 2 items in group2:
$ d-peeler -g "group1 group2" --gS "4 2" dataset

Constraints regarding minimal ratios between numbers of items present
in pairs of groups can be specified in a square matrix input as a
file. Its name is set with option --gr. The ratios in the matrix must
be float numbers. Such a number is the minimal ratio that is allowed
between the number of items present in the group in row and the number
of those in the group in column. The order of the groups is that of
the file names set with the option --groups. Since a ratio between the
number of items in a group and this same number would always be 1, the
diagonal is differently interpreted: they are minimal numbers of items
in the related groups. If both options --gr and --gs are set, the
thresholds in argument of --gs are considered. As an example, these
lines may constitute a file set with --gr:
1 0.325
0.666 2

Because there are two rows (and two columns), two groups must be set
with option --groups. The matrix forces the computed closed n-sets to
have:
- at least 1 item in the first group;
- at least 2 items in the second group;
- a ratio between the number of items present in the first and second
group to be higher than 0.325;
- a ratio between the number of items present in the second and first
group to be higher than 0.666.

Because the groups can be included into each others, option --gr
allows to mine patterns such as confident classification rules (one
group contains all objects in a dimension, the other group those that
are in the class at the right-hand side of the rules), positively
correlated patterns (same setting), emerging patterns (one group
contains the objects in a class, the other groups all remaining
objects in the same dimension), etc. For positively correlated and
emerging patterns, the ratios in the matrix differ from those used to
define the patterns by constant factors (ratios of the total number of
items in the two groups).


*** DATASET REDUCTION  ***

Before the actual extraction, d-peeler removes from the input data
tuples that cannot be covered by any closed n-set satisfying the
minimal size constraints specified through the option --sizes
(-s). That typically makes d-peeler run much faster and the patterns
at the output are guaranyteely the same (although they can be in a
different order and so can their items).

The option --no-reduction (-n) disables the input data reduction. To
only reduced the input data and output the reduction (rather than the
closed n-sets), use option --reduction (-r).


*** EXAMPLE ***

A tiny data set is given as an example in example/example.data. It is
provided with an option file, two group files and a ratio
file. Experiment!
